These Mechs have the ability to manipulate Environments, and use them to fight the enemy.

Notes:
1. Performance of the squad is closely related to types of enemies, and difficulty of game largely depends on the order of islands. If you feel that the squad is weak (in fact it's designed to be a bit strong), try to save hardly handled enemies such as Burrower, Psions and Psion Abomination for late game.
2. Please do not add multiple Shift Mechs to Custom Squad, or their skills will be performed incorrectly.
3. Environments provided by other MODs has been considered in the design, but I don't promise that there will be no bugs when used together, at least there would probably be game balance problems.
4. When the game language is not simplified Chinese, the MOD will be displayed in English. 
5. I'm not a native English speaker, and all translations were done with the help of DeepL Translate, so the English text in MOD must be very terrible. If you are interested in helping to optimize the translation, please open the [scripts/localization/english] directory to make changes and send them to 2994359861@qq.com.
